Introduction The Mammoth Site (www.mammothsite.com) 
is a paleontological dig site, research facility, and well - known tourist 
attraction in the Black Hills. Mammoth Site management wishes to install an 
interactive  display  system  for  visitors.  This  display  will  feature  a 
touch  screen  mounted  in  a kiosk that allows users  to  browse  the  Mammoth
Site  bone bed. The bone bed  database  is currently  accessible  only  in
ArcGIS,  a  large  commercial  software  package.  The  kiosk  software should
permit  a  naive  user  to  pan  and  zoom  around  the  bone  bed  and  obtain
basic  information about a bone specimen without any special training. Problem
Write  kiosk  software  for  the  Mammoth  Site  in  Java  using  Swing. 
Your  program  should  be similar in interface and functionality to ArcGIS 
software (see screen capture below), but without its  complexity.  Render  
the  bone bed  in  the  main  window,  allowing  the  user  to pan and zoom 
around the display. Use different colors in your display to highlight 
different bone characteristics (e.g., different elevations in the bone bed).
Provide a slider that controls the level of detail to be displayed.  Clicking
on (or  hovering  above) a  bone  should  pop  up  a  dialog box  that  displays 
information  about  the  selected  item,  and  an  image  of  the  bone. For
extra  credit,  add  a  search facility that allows users to filter bones 
based on type of mammoth, gender, size, etc.
